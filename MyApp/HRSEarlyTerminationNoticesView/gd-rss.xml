  <title>Don’t pay to get your Employer Identification Number (EIN)</title>
  <link>https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2025/04/dont-pay-get-your-employer-identification-number-ein</link>
  <description>By BCP staff&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Have you ever paid for something and later found out you could have gotten it for free? It might make you wish someone had told you it was free — before you paid. That’s what a lot of people have reported to the FTC about companies charging them hundreds of dollars to get their Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS. But there’s no reason to pay anyone for your EIN. The IRS issues&amp;nbsp;EINs for free.

  <title>Asked to pay to claim a million-dollar prize? Don’t bet on it</title>
  <link>https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2025/03/asked-pay-claim-million-dollar-prize-dont-bet-it</link>
  <description>By BCP Staff&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Scammers sometimes make you think you’ve hit a stroke of good luck. But if your million-dollar cash prize letter comes with instructions to pay a small fee — maybe for taxes, reporting, or handling — it’s not luck. It’s a scam. If you pay, you’ll lose your money and find out there’s no prize. Can you spot a prize scam?
